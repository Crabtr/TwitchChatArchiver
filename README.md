TwitchChatArchiver ![MrDestructoid][0]
===

This is the very simple "chat bot" I use for archiving messages during events.

## Important remarks
* Every channel gets its own connection. In a normal situation this would be
    completely pointless, but Twitch will drop a connection if too many
    messages are in the sending queued to be sent to it and the high volume
    nature of rooms during events means that limit is easily hit.
* The exact maximum number of connections allowed per IP address isn't
    officially documented, but as an anti-spam measure Twitch will drop all of
    your connections and possibly further temporarily ban your IP should you
    open too many. If you want to archive a lot of channels (â‰¥ 50) then
    this project probably isn't for you, but you presumably know that.

## Configuration

* `nick`: The username of the account you want to log in with.
* `oauth`: An oauth token -- [get one here][1]
* `channels`: The channels you want the join. Note that they **must** be
    prefixed with '#.'

The directory structure generated is as follows:
